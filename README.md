No Quote is a hierarchical, plain-text file format aimed at being simple and easy to use and implement.  A specification is provided in noqspec.md, and the software is meant to be a reference implementation (which it currently is not, although it should work as long as you don't try to do any funny business, and only use ASCII whitespace characters).  Currently the software is only written in C, but I would like to extend it to other languages.
